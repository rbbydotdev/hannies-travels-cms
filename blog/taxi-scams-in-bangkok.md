In this article, we will discuss some common scams and provide tips on how to avoid them.

## Taxi Meter Scam

Once you touch down at the airport, excitement and a bit of nervousness are common as you step into the Land of Smiles. To ensure you travel smartly from the get-go, be cautious of the taxi meter scam. Many taxis at the airport are ready to serve you, but some drivers may refuse to use the meter, attempting to overcharge you.
